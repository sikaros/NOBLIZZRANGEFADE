# Changelog

All notable changes to NoBlizzRangeFade will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.0] - 2025-02-02

### Added
- Initial stable release
- Prevents raid and party frames from fading when units are out of range
- Works with Midnight (12.0.0) client
- Continuous monitoring system (checks 10 times per second)
- `/norangefade status` command to check version
- `/norangefade debug` command to toggle debug logging

### Technical Details
- Uses OnUpdate loop (0.1s interval) to disable range display and force alpha
- Avoids all hooks and wrappers to prevent Blizzard's protected code errors
- No lua errors, no taint, stable operation
- Supports both party frames (CompactPartyFrameMember1-5) and raid frames (RaidGroupButton1-40)

### Known Issues
- Minor visual flicker may occur when units move in/out of range (unavoidable without causing lua errors)
- Only works with default Blizzard raid/party frames (not compatible with custom frame addons like ElvUI)

## [0.3.7] - 2025-02-02

### Development Versions
- Multiple diagnostic and testing versions
- Explored various approaches including hooks, wrappers, and polling
- Discovered that any modification to frame properties triggers Blizzard's protection system
- Final solution: continuous monitoring without hooks
